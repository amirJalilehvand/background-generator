# background-generator-team-work

This is a very very basic project recommanded for beginners who trying to start a journey through the great great world of web development.
Background generator works so simple. There's a html file, a css file for styling and a scrpt.js file for all those javaScripts codes we want to add to our web app.
The use case of this project is that the user will choose the background of the website page, using two color inputs which we added to the main page. The colors that the user selects, will create a gradiant color which makes the background so cool. I hope you like it guys.
